Notebook should be self explanatory. Computes the average (volume-weighted) reionization history xHI vs redshift z and the CMB optical depth tau. As-is the code has several options for:
UVLFS: Donnan+24, Bouwens+21, Finkelstein&Bagley22, Chemrynska+24
Ionizing efficiencies xiion: Simmonds24a,24b; Endsley+24, Robertson+15, Munoz+26
Fesc models, either beta-fesc: Chisholm+22, or constant (for the former beta-MUV can be : Bouwens+14, Zhao&Furlanetto24, Jecmen+26*)

If you find this code useful please cite [Muñoz+24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07250). The code reproduces Figure 1 there:

Note that the calculations require (pip)installing [Zeus21](https://github.com/JulianBMunoz/Zeus21) which should be very easy, but reach out if you find any issues!
